        In February 2017, the African Union Commission Citizens and Diaspora Directorate (AUC-CIDO) and the Deutsche
        Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, jointly launched a pilot project - the Interfaith
        Dialogue on Violent Extremism (iDove). This initiative stands out due to its emphasis on the soft power of
        religion
        and innovative youth-led approaches in PVE. iDove is an intercontinental project which specifically targets
        youth
        from Africa and Europe (age 18-35). In 2019, the project further expanded to the Middle East and Southeast Asia.

        The rise of violent extremism has raised concerns about growing fragility, instability, and prejudice that
        divide
        communities worldwide. Violent extremism has, thus, become one of the main challenges to peaceful coexistence
        which
        pose a crucial threat to the goals and aspirations of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as well as the
        2063 Agenda: The Africa We Want.

        iDove is based on the understanding that violent extremism is a global challenge. Whether it has political,
        ideological, or religious roots, extremism is a problem that affects societies globally in similar ways.
        Security
        interventions to address the problem only have limited effects and come at a high cost, both financially and in
        human lives. PVE, therefore, requires a comprehensive ‘soft’ approach that focuses on the root causes rather
        than on
        the symptoms of violent extremism. Sports, arts, and cultural activities offer effective means of dealing with
        differences within a community. Bottom-up, innovative community-based approaches in the areas of academia, arts
        and
        culture, or communication often foster mutual understanding, support, and cooperation between different social
        and
        religious groups
