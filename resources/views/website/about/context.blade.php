                Violent extremism is a highly fueled topic and an issue that has drawn significant attention globally — hindering the trajectory outlined in achieving global development agendas such as the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the African Union Agenda 2063. In 2019 alone, the continent of Africa recorded a massive number of 86 terrorist attacks which resulted in a total of 296 deaths. Some of the main countries that are affected by terrorism are Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Somalia, Rwanda and DRC (in decreasing order of deaths recorded).2 Neither radicalization nor violent extremism is rooted in one cause alone – whether ideological, political or religious – nor can they be tackled simply with security or military means. The spread of violent extremism is first and foremost a development challenge and the drivers of violent extremism are complex, manifold and context-dependent. Factors such as (perceived) socio-economic inequality, repression, social injustice, political marginalization, corruption and poor governance often create an enabling environment for radicalization and violent extremism.

                These factors underline that preventing violent extremism through top-down approaches alone would be insufficient. Adopting a prevention lens that focuses on the ‘soft power’ of religion and dialogue allows the engagement of the community and targets the root causes fueling violent extremism.

                A deep understanding of one’s own religion, as well as knowledge about other religions is important to avoid over-simplified answers, stereotypes, interpretations and to promote tolerance and respect. Religious leaders and organizations play a key role in these processes, especially in remote areas, and are therefore important partners in PVE approaches. The role of religion as a factor of radicalization and violent extremism is a highly contested issue in policy and academic debates. Research renders little support to a direct correlation between the level of religiosity and radicalization. Instead, religion is often instrumentalized by violent extremist groups to justify their actions and therefore should not solely be understood as a potential contributing factor to radicalization. Religious groups and communities have a vital role in preventing violent extremism3 ; their access, credibility, firmly established partner networks and level of trust can support and enable preventive measures and strengthen social cohesion.

                The ‘soft power’ of faith and dialogue can be used to promote peace, mutual understanding, and peaceful coexistence. Religious leaders can take several measures to prevent violent extremism. They can act as educators, intermediaries, advocates, mediators and accompany behavioral changes. Religious leaders are crucial in promoting human rights as a key aspect of PVE. They are often in a unique position of trust to provide important services to their communities and may have greater access to and influence within a community than the governing authorities, rendering them valuable agents to promote human rights and bring about lasting peace.

                A holistic approach is required to foster social cohesion and build resilient societies. Concisely, strengthening social cohesion and resilience from a top-down perspective requires tackling shortcomings in good governance, peace and security, as well as basic service delivery. Simultaneously, a bottom-up approach, which focuses, among other things, on supporting dialogue between local decision-makers and citizens encouraging positive interaction between all members of a community is needed. Non-violent approaches to problem solving and possibilities for community problem-solving shall be created. Sports, arts, cultural events and activities offer effective ways of dealing with differences within a community.

                                    It is against this backdrop that iDove has emerged based on the need to integrate a multidimensional, bottom- up soft approach. iDove brings together youth from Africa, Europe, Middle East and Asia, coming from a variety of backgrounds including policy makers, creative artists, academics, community workers and religious leaders. Together they develop innovative strategies to prevent violent extremism and build social cohesion. As current trends show, youth are the largest group directly affected by violent extremism, due to their vulnerability to recruitment.
